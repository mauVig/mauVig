Hi, nice to meet you. Let me introduce my profile in a few lines.
  <ul>
    <li>👨‍🔧 I'm a <b>Full-Stack developer</b></li>
    <li>📍 I came from <b>Buenos Aires, Argentina</b></li>
    <li>💬 You can ask me about <b>Web page development</b></li>
    <li>📮 You can contact me directly here: <b>Mauro.vigliero@yahoo.com</b>
  </ul>
In high school I had programming classes and we worked a lot with Visual Basic, then after finishing school I dedicated myself to the world of art playing in several bands. Then I studied voice-over at ISER and graduated in 2018. Then during the pandemic in 2020, I began a career in <b>web design and programming</b> at the <b>Da Vinci school</b>. And since that year I began to study different types of programming languages.
